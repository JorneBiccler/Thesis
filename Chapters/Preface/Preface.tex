Lastly I would like to thank some people. First of all I am grateful to my supervisor Brody whose very relaxed laissez-faire approach to supervising motivated me to try things that I would probably not have considered otherwise \footnote{Apparently semi-supervised learning sounds fancy but doesn't really work that well for SDM.}. Furthermore, I would like to thank Tim who made it possible for me to go to Denmark and agreed to act as co-examiner. Finally, I would like to thank my floormates who had to deal with me deciding to make our living room my office every once in a while and my occasional grumpy moods when I found out that my code contained bugs.
