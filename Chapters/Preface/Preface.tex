In this part of my thesis I would like to thank some people. First of all, I am extremely grateful to my supervisor Brody whose very relaxed laissez-faire approach to supervising motivated me to try things that I would probably not have considered otherwise and taught a lot about working individually on problems before requesting help. Furthermore, I would like to thank Tim who made it possible for me to go to Denmark and agreed to act as co-examiner. Obviously I am thankful to my siblings and friends who provided the necessary distractions every once in a while. Although I was not that frequently at my office in the biology department, I am still happy to have been able to eat some great cake with some the other people on the floor.  Finally, I would like to thank the floormates in my dormitory who had to deal with me deciding to make our living room my office every once in a while and for the fun conversations and breaks that ensued.
