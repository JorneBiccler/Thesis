  "A classic in its own right, this book continues to provide an introduction
  to modern generalized linear models for categorical variables. The text
  emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such
  as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic
  regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal)
  responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered,
  correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the
  exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other
  major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on
  analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal
  data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book. R
  and SAS are now showcased as the software of choice. An author web site with
  solutions, commentaries, software programs, and data sets is available"--%

  The framework of a national land use and land cover classification system is
  presented for use with remote sensor data. The classification system has been
  developed to meet the needs of Federal and State agencies for an up-to-date
  overview of land use and land cover throughout the country on a basis that is
  uniform in categorization at the more generalized first and second levels and
  that will be receptive to data from satellite and aircraft remote sensors.
  The proposed system uses the features of existing widely used classification
  systems that are amenable to data derived from remote sensing sources. It is
  intentionally left open-ended so that Federal, regional, State, and local
  agencies can have flexibility in developing more detailed land use
  classifications at the third and fourth levels in order to meet their
  particular needs and at the same time remain compatible with each other and
  the national system. Revision of the land use classification system as
  presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 671 was undertaken in order to
  incorporate the results of extensive testing and review of the categorization
  and definitions.%

  1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions
  in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species
  distribution models require data on both species presence and the available
  environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the
  area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these
  pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a
  comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species
  distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many
  pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution
  models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data
  (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative
  effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs.
  environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive
  accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and
  machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the
  method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the
  model’s predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the
  most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of
  pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum
  of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most
  accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning
  techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model
  accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for
  regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we
  recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with
  equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques
  (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging
  several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal
  weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression
  splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of
  pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few
  pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression
  trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the
  random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the
  random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified
  pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.%

  The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
  familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point
  out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing
  is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
  rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent
  to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore,
  in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of
  the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
  sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery
  rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the
  gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
  appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.%

  The duality between “niche” and “biotope” proposed by G. Evelyn
  Hutchinson provides a powerful way to conceptualize and analyze
  biogeographical distributions in relation to spatial environmental patterns.
  Both Joseph Grinnell and Charles Elton had attributed niches to environments.
  Attributing niches, instead, to species, allowed Hutchinson's key innovation:
  the formal severing of physical place from environment that is expressed by
  the duality. In biogeography, the physical world (a spatial extension of what
  Hutchinson called the biotope) is conceived as a map, each point (or cell) of
  which is characterized by its geographical coordinates and the local values
  of n environmental attributes at a given time. Exactly the same n
  environmental attributes define the corresponding niche space, as niche axes,
  allowing reciprocal projections between the geographic distribution of a
  species, actual or potential, past or future, and its niche. In
  biogeographical terms, the realized niche has come to express not only the
  effects of species interactions (as Hutchinson intended), but also
  constraints of dispersal limitation and the lack of contemporary environments
  corresponding to parts of the fundamental niche. Hutchinson's duality has
  been used to classify and map environments; model potential species
  distributions under past, present, and future climates; study the
  distributions of invasive species; discover new species; and simulate
  increasingly more realistic worlds, leading to spatially explicit, stochastic
  models that encompass speciation, extinction, range expansion, and
  evolutionary adaptation to changing environments.%

  Aim Remote sensing data have been used in a growing number of studies to
  directly predict species richness or to improve the performance of species
  distribution models (SDMs), but their suitability for stacked species
  distribution models (S-SDMs) remains unclear. In this case study, we
  evaluated the potential and limitations of remotely sensed data in S-SDMs and
  addressed the commonly observed overestimation of species richness by S-SDMs.
  Location Mexico. Methods Phenological and statistical metrics were derived
  from remotely sensed time series data (2001–2009) of the Terra-MODIS
  enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature products. In a series
  of climatic and remote sensing-based SDMs, the distribution ranges of 40
  species of the genus Pinus (Pinaceae) were modelled based on presence-only
  herbarium and field data using the maximum entropy algorithm and summed to
  estimate species richness. Three different species-specific thresholds were
  applied to convert continuous model predictions into binary maps. Modelled
  species richness was compared to independent data from the Mexican National
  Forest Inventory. Results The inclusion of remote sensing data led to
  significantly better predictions of species richness in comparison to the
  climate-based models for the summed suitabilities and all thresholds
  considered. Both climatic and remote sensing-based models allowed us to
  identify the areas with the highest pine species richness based on
  presence-only data. Remote sensing-based models compare closely with
  climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and more
  detailed information on local habitat availability. Main conclusions The
  results of this case study provide general guidance for the potential and
  limitations of using remote sensing data in S-SDMs. Our results confirmed
  that remote sensing data may not only have the capability for improving
  individual SDMs, but also can be a potential tool for reducing the
  overestimation of species richness by S-SDMs. This approach opens up new
  possibilities for species richness predictions in areas where biological
  survey data are scarce and where no species richness inventory data exist.%

  ABSTRACT: The demand for spatial climate data in digital form has risen
  dramatically in recent years. In response to this need, a variety of
  statistical techniques have been used to facilitate the production of
  GIS-compatible climate maps. However, observational data are often too sparse
  and unrepresentative to directly support the creation of high-quality climate
  maps and data sets that truly represent the current state of knowledge. An
  effective approach is to use the wealth of expert knowledge on the spatial
  patterns of climate and their relationships with geographic features, termed
  Œgeospatial climatology¹, to help enhance, control, and parameterize a
  statistical technique. Described here is a dynamic knowledge-based framework
  that allows for the effective accumulation, application, and refinement of
  climatic knowledge, as expressed in a statistical regression model known as
  PRISM (parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model). The
  ultimate goal is to develop an expert system capable of reproducing the
  process a knowledgeable climatologist would use to create high-quality
  climate maps, with the added benefits of consistency and repeatability.
  However, knowledge must first be accumulated and evaluated through an ongoing
  process of model application; development of knowledge prototypes, parameters
  and parameter settings; testing; evaluation; and modification. This paper
  describes the current state of a knowledge-based framework for climate
  mapping and presents specific algorithms from PRISM to demonstrate how this
  framework is applied and refined to accommodate difficult climate mapping
  situations. A weighted climate-elevation regression function acknowledges the
  dominant influence of elevation on climate. Climate stations are assigned
  weights that account for other climatically important factors besides
  elevation. Aspect and topographic exposure, which affect climate at a variety
  of scales, from hill slope to windward and leeward sides of mountain ranges,
  are simulated by dividing the terrain into topographic facets. A coastal
  proximity measure is used to account for sharp climatic gradients near
  coastlines. A 2-layer model structure divides the atmosphere into a lower
  boundary layer and an upper free atmosphere layer, allowing the simulation of
  temperature inversions, as well as mid-slope precipitation maxima. The
  effectiveness of various terrain configurations at producing orographic
  precipitation enhancement is also estimated. Climate mapping examples are
  presented.%

  Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually
  in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive
  ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it
  inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to
  the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model.
  Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one
  region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown
  structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of
  collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ
  between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across
  disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have
  been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based
  pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and
  regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response
  relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we
  compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and
  machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by
  testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested
  whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in
  a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on
  a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically
  designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based
  models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based
  pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with
  penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when
  omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all
  approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity
  structure and the ‘folk lore’-thresholds of correlation coefficients
  between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an
  appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model
  estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of
  the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least
  sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but
  cannot ultimately solve them.%

  * 1Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and
  need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their
  data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. * 2This study provides a
  working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for
  fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional
  techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression
  trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that
  relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and
  boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give
  improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an
  additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted
  in a forward, stagewise fashion. * 3Boosted regression trees incorporate
  important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of
  predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for
  prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex
  nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between
  predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of
  single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although
  BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful
  ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most
  traditional modelling methods. * 4The unique features of BRT raise a number
  of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and
  advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned
  eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand.
  We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several
  settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We
  provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.%

  Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine
  observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates.
  They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict
  distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space
  and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine
  realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences
  in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and
  robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling
  method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and
  geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current
  linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering
  progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling
  presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for
  biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.%

  Prediction of species’ distributions is central to diverse applications in
  ecology, evolution and conservation science. There is increasing electronic
  access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little
  effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of
  numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we
  compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world,
  creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used
  presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to
  evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such
  as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that
  either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling
  species’ distributions. These include machine-learning methods and
  community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly
  well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species’
  occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species’
  distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently
  outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are
  promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as
  methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.%

  Statistical modeling of presence-only data has attracted much recent
  attention in the ecological literature, leading to a proliferation of
  methods, including the inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) model, maximum
  entropy (Maxent) modeling of species distributions and logistic regression
  models. Several recent articles have shown the close relationships between
  these methods. We explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural
  object of inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability
  (which is only defined with reference to quadrat size), and why presence-only
  data only allows estimation of relative, and not absolute intensity of
  species occurrence. All three of the above techniques amount to parametric
  density estimation under the same exponential family model (in the case of
  the IPP, the fitted density is multiplied by the number of presence records
  to obtain a fitted intensity). We show that IPP and Maxent give the exact
  same estimate for this density, but logistic regression in general yields a
  different estimate in finite samples. When the model is misspecified - as it
  practically always is - logistic regression and the IPP may have
  substantially different asymptotic limits with large data sets. We propose
  ``infinitely weighted logistic regression,'' which is exactly equivalent to
  the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many already-implemented methods
  extending logistic regression can also extend the Maxent and IPP models in
  directly analogous ways using this technique.%

  Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification
  methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification
  algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a
  weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many
  classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic
  improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious
  phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles,
  namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem,
  boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the
  logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop
  more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical
  results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial
  likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently
  proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far
  superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce
  computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights
  to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This
  approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better
  performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate
  decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more
  suitable to large-scale data mining applications.%

  In the last two decades, interest in species distribution models (SDMs) of
  plants and animals has grown dramatically. Recent advances in SDMs allow us
  to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at
  different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of
  SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an
  overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles
  and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and
  decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular
  emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change
  impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for
  incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and
  community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these
  issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the
  development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased
  in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they
  statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities
  to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to
  cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate
  change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present
  a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of
  statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its
  generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling
  species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and
  classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g.
  GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The
  selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical
  considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings
  on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche).
  Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing
  accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution
  modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor
  variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New
  methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating
  characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap,
  cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of
  predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven
  primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the
  attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors
  (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range
  of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of
  applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the
  qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that
  define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather
  than on statistics alone.%

  Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the
  middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a nonlinear summary of the
  data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The
  algorithm for constructing principal curves starts with some prior summary,
  such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive
  iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the
  definition of local is based on the distance in arc length of the projections
  of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article
  principal curves are defined, an algorithm for their construction is given,
  some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to
  other generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate
  the use of principal curves. The first describes how the principal-curve
  procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The
  collider uses about 950 magnets in a roughly circular arrangement to bend
  electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction,
  it was found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of
  place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and could not be
  focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to
  their originally planned locations, but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc
  through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the
  principal-curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays
  for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste appear to show
  some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The
  classical approach using linear errors in variables regression can detect
  systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities.
  When the first linear principal component is replaced with a principal curve,
  a local “bump” is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its
  presence.%

  Aim  The role of biotic interactions in influencing species distributions
  at macro-scales remains poorly understood. Here we test whether predictions
  of distributions for four boreal owl species at two macro-scales (10 × 10 km
  and 40 × 40 km grid resolutions) are improved by incorporating interactions
  with woodpeckers into climate envelope models. Location  Finland, northern
  Europe. Methods  Distribution data for four owl and six woodpecker species,
  along with data for six land cover and three climatic variables, were
  collated from 2861 10 × 10 km grid cells. Generalized additive models were
  calibrated using a 50\% random sample of the species data from western
  Finland, and by repeating this procedure 20 times for each of the four owl
  species. Models were fitted using three sets of explanatory variables: (1)
  climate only; (2) climate and land cover; and (3) climate, land cover and two
  woodpecker interaction variables. Models were evaluated using three
  approaches: (1) examination of explained deviance; (2) four-fold
  cross-validation using the model calibration data; and (3) comparison of
  predicted and observed values for independent grid cells in eastern Finland.
  The model accuracy for approaches (2) and (3) was measured using the area
  under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic plot. Results  At
  10-km resolution, inclusion of the distribution of woodpeckers as a predictor
  variable significantly improved the explanatory power, cross-validation
  statistics and the predictive accuracy of the models. Inclusion of land cover
  led to similar improvements at 10-km resolution, although these improvements
  were less apparent at 40-km resolution for both land cover and biotic
  interactions. Main conclusions  Predictions of species distributions at
  macro-scales may be significantly improved by incorporating biotic
  interactions and land cover variables into models. Our results are important
  for models used to predict the impacts of climate change, and emphasize the
  need for comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of species–climate
  impact models.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to forecast impacts
  of climate change on species geographic distributions, but the reliability of
  predictions is scrutinized. The main limitation of SDMs lies in their
  assumption that species’ ranges are determined mostly by climate, which is
  arguable. For instance, biotic interactions, habitat and elevation may affect
  species ranges. The inclusion of habitat-related variables as predictors in
  SDMs is generally accepted, but there is no consensus regarding the inclusion
  of elevation. A review of randomly chosen literature revealed that elevation
  is used as a predictor variable by just over half of the papers studied with
  no apparent trends as to why, except that papers predicting mammal species
  distributions for large regions included elevation more often than not, and
  that papers that predicted mammal ranges for small regions tended to exclude
  elevation. In addition, we compared the performance of SDMs with and without
  elevation as a predictor variable for the distribution of north European
  mammals and plants and found that the difference between their performances
  is statistically significant for mammals, slightly favouring exclusion of
  elevation. No differences were found for plants.%

  Aim  The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)
  is a widely used statistic for assessing the discriminatory capacity of
  species distribution models. Here, I used simulated data to examine the
  interdependence of the AUC and classical discrimination measures (sensitivity
  and specificity) derived for the application of a threshold. I shall further
  exemplify with simulated data the implications of using the AUC to evaluate
  potential versus realized distribution models. Innovation  After applying
  the threshold that makes sensitivity and specificity equal, a strong
  relationship between the AUC and these two measures was found. This result is
  corroborated with real data. On the other hand, the AUC penalizes the models
  that estimate potential distributions (the regions where the species could
  survive and reproduce due to the existence of suitable environmental
  conditions), and favours those that estimate realized distributions (the
  regions where the species actually lives). Main conclusions  Firstly, the
  independence of the AUC from the threshold selection may be irrelevant in
  practice. This result also emphasizes the fact that the AUC assumes nothing
  about the relative costs of errors of omission and commission. However, in
  most real situations this premise may not be optimal. Measures derived from a
  contingency table for different cost ratio scenarios, together with the ROC
  curve, may be more informative than reporting just a single AUC value.
  Secondly, the AUC is only truly informative when there are true instances of
  absence available and the objective is the estimation of the realized
  distribution. When the potential distribution is the goal of the research,
  the AUC is not an appropriate performance measure because the weight of
  commission errors is much lower than that of omission errors.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, known as
  the AUC, is currently considered to be the standard method to assess the
  accuracy of predictive distribution models. It avoids the supposed
  subjectivity in the threshold selection process, when continuous probability
  derived scores are converted to a binary presence–absence variable, by
  summarizing overall model performance over all possible thresholds. In this
  manuscript we review some of the features of this measure and bring into
  question its reliability as a comparative measure of accuracy between model
  results. We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the
  predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it
  summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one
  would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally;
  (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model
  errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are
  carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC
  scores.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The problem of variable selection within the class of generalized additive
  models, when there are many covariates to choose from but the number of
  predictors is still somewhat smaller than the number of observations, is
  considered. Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension
  of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid
  having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general
  reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out
  in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an
  exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the
  proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an
  extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one
  method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers
  with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing
  data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in
  the United States.%

  Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to explain and predict
  species ranges and environmental niches. They are most commonly constructed
  by inferring species' occurrence–environment relationships using
  statistical and machine-learning methods. The variety of methods that can be
  used to construct SDMs (e.g. generalized linear/additive models, tree-based
  models, maximum entropy, etc.), and the variety of ways that such models can
  be implemented, permits substantial flexibility in SDM complexity. Building
  models with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is
  critical for robust inference. We characterize complexity as the shape of the
  inferred occurrence–environment relationships and the number of parameters
  used to describe them, and search for insights into whether additional
  complexity is informative or superfluous. By building ‘under fit’ models,
  having insufficient flexibility to describe observed occurrence–environment
  relationships, we risk misunderstanding the factors shaping species
  distributions. By building ‘over fit’ models, with excessive flexibility,
  we risk inadvertently ascribing pattern to noise or building opaque models.
  However, model selection can be challenging, especially when comparing models
  constructed under different modeling approaches. Here we argue for a more
  pragmatic approach: researchers should constrain the complexity of their
  models based on study objective, attributes of the data, and an understanding
  of how these interact with the underlying biological processes. We discuss
  guidelines for balancing under fitting with over fitting and consequently how
  complexity affects decisions made during model building. Although some
  generalities are possible, our discussion reflects differences in opinions
  that favor simpler versus more complex models. We conclude that combining
  insights from both simple and complex SDM building approaches best advances
  our knowledge of current and future species ranges.%

  The climatic conditions of mountain habitats are greatly influenced by
  topography. Large differences in microclimate occur with small changes in
  elevation, and this complex interaction is an important determinant of
  mountain plant distributions. In spite of this, elevation is not often
  considered as a relevant predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) for
  mountain plants. Here, we evaluated the importance of including elevation as
  a predictor in SDMs for mountain plant species. We generated two sets of SDMs
  for each of 73 plant species that occur in the Pacific Northwest of North
  America; one set of models included elevation as a predictor variable and the
  other set did not. AUC scores indicated that omitting elevation as a
  predictor resulted in a negligible reduction of model performance. However,
  further analysis revealed that the omission of elevation resulted in large
  over-predictions of species’ niche breadths—this effect was most
  pronounced for species that occupy the highest elevations. In addition, the
  inclusion of elevation as a predictor constrained the effects of other
  predictors that superficially affected the outcome of the models generated
  without elevation. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of elevation as
  a predictor variable improves the quality of SDMs for high-elevation plant
  species. Because of the negligible AUC score penalty for over-predicting
  niche breadth, our results support the notion that AUC scores alone should
  not be used as a measure of model quality. More generally, our results
  illustrate the importance of selecting biologically relevant predictor
  variables when constructing SDMs.%

  * 1Presence-only data, for which there is no information on locations where
  the species is absent, are common in both animal and plant studies. In many
  situations, these may be the only data available on a species. We need
  effective ways to use these data to explore species distribution or species
  use of habitat. * 2Many analytical approaches have been used to model
  presence-only data, some inappropriately. We provide a synthesis and critique
  of statistical methods currently in use to both estimate and evaluate these
  models, and discuss the critical importance of study design in models where
  only presence can be identified * 3Profile or envelope methods exist to
  characterize environmental covariates that describe the locations where
  organisms are found. Predictions from profile approaches are generally
  coarse, but may be useful when species records, environmental predictors and
  biological understanding are scarce. * 4Alternatively, one can build models
  to contrast environmental attributes associated with known locations with a
  sample of random landscape locations, termed either ‘pseudo-absences’ or
  ‘available’. Great care needs to be taken when selecting random landscape
  locations, because the way in which they are selected determines the
  modelling techniques that can be applied. * 5Regression-based models can
  provide predictions of the relative likelihood of occurrence, and in some
  situations predictions of the probability of occurrence. The logistic model
  is frequently applied, but can rarely be used directly to estimate these
  models; instead, case–control or logistic discrimination should be used
  depending on the sample design. * 6Cross-validation can be used to evaluate
  model performance and to assess how effectively the model reflects a quantity
  proportional to the probability of occurrence. However, more research is
  needed to develop a single measure or statistic that summarizes model
  performance for presence-only data. * 7Synthesis and applications. A number
  of statistical procedures are available to explore patterns in presence-only
  data; the choice among them depends on the quality of the presence-only data.
  Presence-only records can provide insight into the vulnerability, historical
  distribution and conservation status of species. Models developed using these
  data can inform management. Our caveat is that researchers must be mindful of
  study design and the biases inherent in presence data, and be cautious in the
  interpretation of model predictions.%

  Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change
  on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the
  characterization of a species’ bioclimate envelope. A number of recent
  critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the
  many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining
  species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors
  include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This
  paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and
  discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling
  strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the
  natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the
  bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to
  the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However,
  it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of
  fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted
  without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical
  modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can
  be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.%

  A modelling framework for studying the combined effects of climate and
  land-cover changes on the distribution of species is presented. The model
  integrates land-cover data into a correlative bioclimatic model in a
  scale-dependent hierarchical manner, whereby Artificial Neural Networks are
  used to characterise species’ climatic requirements at the European scale
  and land-cover requirements at the British scale. The model has been tested
  against an alternative non-hierarchical approach and has been applied to four
  plant species in Britain: Rhynchospora alba, Erica tetralix, Salix herbacea
  and Geranium sylvaticum. Predictive performance has been evaluated using
  Cohen's Kappa statistic and the area under the Receiver Operating
  Characteristic curve, and a novel approach to identifying thresholds of
  occurrence which utilises three levels of confidence has been applied.
  Results demonstrate reasonable to good predictive performance for each
  species, with the main patterns of distribution simulated at both 10 km and 1
  km resolutions. The incorporation of land-cover data was found to
  significantly improve purely climate-driven predictions for R. alba and E.
  tetralix, enabling regions with suitable climate but unsuitable land-cover to
  be identified. The study thus provides an insight into the roles of climate
  and land-cover as determinants of species’ distributions and it is
  demonstrated that the modelling approach presented can provide a useful
  framework for making predictions of distributions under scenarios of changing
  climate and land-cover type. The paper confirms the potential utility of
  multi-scale approaches for understanding environmental limitations to
  species’ distributions, and demonstrates that the search for environmental
  correlates with species’ distributions must be addressed at an appropriate
  spatial scale. Our study contributes to the mounting evidence that
  hierarchical schemes are characteristic of ecological systems.%

  The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive
  and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of
  species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some
  species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing
  the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence
  data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use
  of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic
  distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine
  learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it
  has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution
  modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform
  a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland
  species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent,
  Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly
  used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set
  Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence
  records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing.
  Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far
  superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models
  were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and
  receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC
  curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better
  discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The
  Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many
  applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and
  development.%

  Accurate modeling of geographic distributions of species is crucial to
  various applications in ecology and conservation. The best performing
  techniques often require some parameter tuning, which may be prohibitively
  time-consuming to do separately for each species, or unreliable for small or
  biased datasets. Additionally, even with the abundance of good quality data,
  users interested in the application of species models need not have the
  statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning. In such cases, it is
  desirable to use “default settings”, tuned and validated on diverse
  datasets. Maxent is a recently introduced modeling technique, achieving high
  predictive accuracy and enjoying several additional attractive properties.
  The performance of Maxent is influenced by a moderate number of parameters.
  The first contribution of this paper is the empirical tuning of these
  parameters. Since many datasets lack information about species absence, we
  present a tuning method that uses presence-only data. We evaluate our method
  on independently collected high-quality presence-absence data. In addition to
  tuning, we introduce several concepts that improve the predictive accuracy
  and running time of Maxent. We introduce “hinge features” that model more
  complex relationships in the training data; we describe a new logistic output
  format that gives an estimate of probability of presence; finally we explore
  “background sampling” strategies that cope with sample selection bias and
  decrease model-building time. Our evaluation, based on a diverse dataset of
  226 species from 6 regions, shows: 1) default settings tuned on presence-only
  data achieve performance which is almost as good as if they had been tuned on
  the evaluation data itself; 2) hinge features substantially improve model
  performance; 3) logistic output improves model calibration, so that large
  differences in output values correspond better to large differences in
  suitability; 4) “target-group” background sampling can give much better
  predictive performance than random background sampling; 5) random background
  sampling results in a dramatic decrease in running time, with no decrease in
  model performance.%

  Modeling the spatial distribution of a species is a fundamental problem in
  ecology. A number of modeling methods have been developed, an extremely
  popular one being MAXENT, a maximum entropy modeling approach. In this
  article, we show that MAXENT is equivalent to a Poisson regression model and
  hence is related to a Poisson point process model, differing only in the
  intercept term, which is scale-dependent in MAXENT. We illustrate a number of
  improvements to MAXENT that follow from these relations. In particular, a
  point process model approach facilitates methods for choosing the appropriate
  spatial resolution, assessing model adequacy, and choosing the LASSO penalty
  parameter, all currently unavailable to MAXENT. The equivalence result
  represents a significant step in the unification of the species distribution
  modeling literature.%

  Aim  Various statistical techniques have been used to model species
  probabilities of occurrence in response to environmental conditions. This
  paper provides a comprehensive assessment of methods and investigates whether
  errors in model predictions are associated to specific kinds of geographical
  and environmental distributions of species. Location  Portugal, Western
  Europe. Methods  Probabilities of occurrence for 44 species of amphibians
  and reptiles in Portugal were modelled using seven modelling techniques:
  Gower metric, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, classification trees, neural
  networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models and spatial
  interpolators. Generalized linear and additive models were constructed with
  and without a term accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Model performance
  was measured using two methods: sensitivity and Kappa index. Species were
  grouped according to their spatial (area of occupancy and extent of
  occurrence) and environmental (marginality and tolerance) distributions.
  Two-way comparison tests were performed to detect significant interactions
  between models and species groups. Results  Interaction between model and
  species groups was significant for both sensitivity and Kappa index. This
  indicates that model performance varied for species with different
  geographical and environmental distributions. Artificial neural networks
  performed generally better, immediately followed by generalized additive
  models including a covariate term for spatial autocorrelation. Non-parametric
  methods were preferred to parametric approaches, especially when modelling
  distributions of species with a greater area of occupancy, a larger extent of
  occurrence, lower marginality and higher tolerance. Main conclusions  This
  is a first attempt to relate performance of modelling techniques with species
  spatial and environmental distributions. Results indicate a strong
  relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions
  being modelled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was
  superior in all circumstances. A suggestion is made that choice of the
  appropriate method should be contingent on the goals and kinds of
  distributions being modelled.%

  In the recent past, availability of large data sets of species presences has
  increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with developments in
  geographical information systems and statistical methods, has enabled
  scientists to calculate, for thousands of species, the environmental
  conditions of their distributional areas. The profiles thus obtained are
  obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated
  from those in Elton’s tradition. I argue that it is useful to define
  Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used
  to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured,
  and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory
  notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain
  formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches. This
  brings clarity to several practical and fundamental questions in macroecology
  and biogeography.%

  Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via
  ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet
  important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that
  conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of
  “niche” that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like
  fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual
  distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche
  conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a
  quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we
  display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is
  an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of
  apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we
  suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the
  probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the
  issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling
  algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data
  calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We
  conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much
  better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process
  are made explicit.%

  The threat to biodiversity due to invasive alien species is considered second
  only to that of habitat loss. Given the large number of species that are
  currently invading ecosystems all over the world, we need to distinguish
  invaders with minor effects from those with large effects in order to
  prioritize management efforts. Ecological niche models can be used to predict
  the potential distribution of an invasive species from occurrence records and
  environmental data layers. We used the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis
  (ENFA), a presence-only predictive modelling approach, to describe the
  invasive ring-necked parakeets’ realized niche and to identify areas
  suitable for the parakeet in northern Belgium. ENFA proved to be a robust and
  reliable modelling technique, able to gauge the ecological requirements of an
  invasive species without the need to include historical information on the
  starting point of the invasion. ENFA shows that the parakeets tend to occupy
  relatively rare habitats compared to the main environmental conditions in
  northern Belgium, although they show some tolerance for environmental
  conditions inside parks and forests. The general distribution of the
  ring-necked parakeet is governed primarily by the amount of older forest
  patches, parks and built-up area in the landscape—reflecting the
  parakeets’ need for suitable nesting cavities and its reliance upon urban
  areas to forage. Our resulting habitat suitability maps show that the
  parakeets have ample room to further increase their range in northern
  Belgium. Our results indicate some concern for increased competition between
  parakeets and the nuthatches, native cavity nesters known to suffer from
  competition with parakeets, as some regions known as nuthatch strongholds are
  highly likely to be invaded by the parakeets.%

  Aim  To assess the influence of land cover and climate on species
  distributions across Europe. To quantify the importance of land cover to
  describe and predict species distributions after using climate as the main
  driver. Location  The study area is Europe. Methods  (1) A multivariate
  analysis was applied to describe land-cover distribution across Europe and
  assess if the land cover is determined by climate at large spatial scales.
  (2) To evaluate the importance of land cover to predict species
  distributions, we implemented a spatially explicit iterative procedure to
  predict species distributions of plants (2603 species), mammals (186
  species), breeding birds (440 species), amphibian and reptiles (143 species).
  First, we ran bioclimatic models using stepwise generalized additive models
  using bioclimatic variables. Secondly, we carried out a regression of land
  cover (LC) variables against residuals from the bioclimatic models to select
  the most relevant LC variables. Finally, we produced mixed models including
  climatic variables and those LC variables selected as decreasing the residual
  of bioclimatic models. Then we compared the explanatory and predictive power
  of the pure bioclimatic against the mixed model. Results  (1) At the
  European coarse resolution, land cover is mainly driven by climate. Two
  bioclimatic axes representing a gradient of temperature and a gradient of
  precipitation explained most variation of land-cover distribution. (2) The
  inclusion of land cover improved significantly the explanatory power of
  bioclimatic models and the most relevant variables across groups were those
  not explained or poorly explained by climate. However, the predictive power
  of bioclimatic model was not improved by the inclusion of LC variables in the
  iterative model selection process. Main conclusion  Climate is the major
  driver of both species and land-cover distributions over Europe. Yet, LC
  variables that are not explained or weakly associated with climate (inland
  water, sea or arable land) are interesting to describe particular mammal,
  bird and tree distributions. However, the addition of LC variables to pure
  bioclimatic models does not improve their predictive accuracy.%

  We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso'
  minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute
  value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature
  of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0
  and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the
  lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and
  ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and
  exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting
  relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and
  Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of
  statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and
  tree-based models are briefly described.%

  Summary In ecological modeling of the habitat of a species, it can be
  prohibitively expensive to determine species absence. Presence-only data
  consist of a sample of locations with observed presences and a separate group
  of locations sampled from the full landscape, with unknown presences. We
  propose an expectation–maximization algorithm to estimate the underlying
  presence–absence logistic model for presence-only data. This algorithm can
  be used with any off-the-shelf logistic model. For models with stepwise
  fitting procedures, such as boosted trees, the fitting process can be
  accelerated by interleaving expectation steps within the procedure.
  Preliminary analyses based on sampling from presence–absence records of
  fish in New Zealand rivers illustrate that this new procedure can reduce both
  deviance and the shrinkage of marginal effect estimates that occur in the
  naive model often used in practice. Finally, it is shown that the population
  prevalence of a species is only identifiable when there is some unrealistic
  constraint on the structure of the logistic model. In practice, it is
  strongly recommended that an estimate of population prevalence be provided.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Presence-only data, point locations where a species has been recorded as
  being present, are often used in modeling the distribution of a species as a
  function of a set of explanatory variables—whether to map species
  occurrence, to understand its association with the environment, or to predict
  its response to environmental change. Currently, ecologists most commonly
  analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen “pseudo-absences” to
  the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach
  which has weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in
  implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process
  modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the
  proposed approach and logistic regression—specifically, we show that as the
  number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random
  arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors
  converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We
  discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point
  process modeling offers a framework for choice of the number and location of
  pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes
  ineffective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.%

  * 1The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well
  established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of
  papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals
  suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in
  which a multiple regression approach was used, 57\% of studies used a
  stepwise procedure. * 2The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple
  regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model
  selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple
  hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best
  model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. * 3We use a worked
  example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to
  highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise
  regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained
  from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models,
  they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds
  with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. * 4An
  information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates
  why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT
  approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the
  data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for
  inference.%

  As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate, understanding the
  consequences becomes increasingly important. Species distribution models
  (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project
  future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to
  the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the
  models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into
  distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and
  mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the
  application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional
  algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation
  types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird
  species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070.
  Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of
  species in some “hotspots” of vulnerability. Differences in
  distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences,
  creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future
  assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be
  addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to
  incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and
  decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with
  the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this
  will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented,
  and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the
  uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option.%

  Generalized additive models (GAMs) have been popularized by the work of
  Hastie and Tibshirani (Generalized Additive Models (1990)) and the
  availability of user friendly gam software in Splus. However, whilst it is
  flexible and efficient, the gam framework based on backfitting with linear
  smoothers presents some difficulties when it comes to model selection and
  inference. On the other hand, the mathematically elegant work of Wahba
  (Spline Models for Observational Data (1990)) and co-workers on Generalized
  Spline Smoothing (GSS) provides a rigorous framework for model selection
  (SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput. 12 (1991) 383) and inference with GAMs
  constructed from smoothing splines: but unfortunately these models are
  computationally very expensive with operations counts that are of cubic order
  in the number of data. A ‘middle way’ between these approaches is to
  construct GAMs using penalized regression splines (e.g. Marx and Eilers,
  Comput. Statist. Data Anal. (1998)). In this paper, we develop this idea
  further and show how GAMs constructed using penalized regression splines can
  be used to get most of the practical benefits of GSS models, including well
  founded model selection and multi-dimensional smooth terms, with the ease of
  use and low computational cost of backfit GAMs. Inference with the resulting
  methods also requires slightly fewer approximations than are employed in the
  GAM modelling software provided in Splus. This paper presents the basic
  mathematical and numerical approach to GAMs implemented in the R package
  mgcv, and includes two environmental examples using the methods as
  implemented in the package.%

  The distribution limits of three species, in the British Isles are discussed.
  For Verbena officinalis and Tilia cordata low temperatures are shown to
  influence distribution, by limiting the capacity either to flower or to
  fertilize ovules, respectively. In the case of Umbilicus rupestris, a
  long-term transplant population beyond the natural geographical limit of the
  species has evolved new low-temperature responses of seed germination and
  winter survival. The effect is a marked change of phenology, compared with
  populations of the species within its natural range, which enhances the
  capacity of the population to survive in a colder environment.%
