- PhD applications in Denmark/Scandinavia



## 

- Data used in SDM: 
	* Presence/absence vs presence only (+ pseudo-absence)
	* Climate data (Bioclim) / RS data
	* "Concepts" of scale in ecology (depending on the scale of the observations using "patchy" high res RS data not that appropriate,
									  see also Graham et al 2008)
	* Maybe RS data most relevant when modelling "stationary" species.
	* Paper chase
	* Small scale => small prevalence!
	* Multicollinearity / large amount of explanatory variables

- Methods used in SDM: 
   	* Presence only: MaxEnt above with pseudo-absences
   	* Connections and difference between these approaches
   	* Hierarchical vs non-hierarchical approach (see e.g. article by Pearson et al 2004): 
   		1)  seems reasonable to use hierarhical appraoch since on global scale the 
   			distribution seems mainly determined by climate (also more data), 
   			=> regional add extra land-use data + climate model from a larger survey area could improve 
   			robustness / credibility of the large scale climate model/mechanism.
   		2) "uncouples" climate and land-cover data (both an advantage and disadvantage?) 
   		3) however the projection into 2 spaces of lower dimensions doesn't allow for 
   			climate / land-use interactions (not really a problem when e.g. using GAMs without multivariate splines,
   			but still it seems that model selection would be "non-optimal") ? 
   		4) doesn't allow for an "distanglement" of confounders => suboptimal model selection at best
		5) example of fine and coarse scale interaction; species might be able to deal better with
		   high average temperatures (coarse) when there are water sources nearby (fine).

- Methods for variable selection / DR: 
	* Could perhaps include performance indices etc.
	* Wollan et al; modelling and predicting fungal distribution patterns using herbarium data (combining lasso and other
	selection methods) on the other hand Merow et al (A practical guide to MaxEnt for modeling species) recomends to preprocess anyway ...


- 2 (or more) applications/analyses:
	* 1 one presence only 
	* 1 presence/absence (once again note difference in interpretation between 
						  MaxEnt and the presence/absence methods)

- Simulation study (virtualspecies R package ?): 
	* Different functional forms of response functions
	* Different amount of correlation + non-linear relations between variables
	* Different amount of variables	
	* Interaction vs no interactions across scales (especially if the hierarchical approach would be used)
	* Presence/absence vs presence only
	* Usage: extrapolation vs interpolation in the survey area
	* Different scales

## Optional / extra ideas
   	* Model averaging
   	* FIC could be interesting for some applications?
robust methods:
- Introduction:
	* older observations + some land cover change over time (e.g. wildfires / logging amazon / ...) => some "outliers"
	* museum records + scale of the observation
	* ...
- Robust GLMs, "easy" for presence absence data, but for presence background data it might matter that 
			the background can't be wrong (excluding errors in the explanatory variables which are prevalent throughout
			sdm, namely climate interpolation errors)?
- "Robustify" Maxent (seems doable with the "fit as glm approach by Hastie et al")
- Application
- Simulation study

## Outline presence only
=> define L, U, ... as in paper shapire etc (see toRead) and note that except for intercept they should lead to the same estimate ?
=> inrepretation dependent on quadrant size (see paper hastie et al. MaxEnt equivalence)
